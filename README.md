# Class_Portfolio
A single comprehensive graphical C++ portfolio of all our major SFML projects throughout the semester. This class was a computer science fundamentals class
(the second in the sequence) and taught by Dave Smith

Potfolio Highlights:

One of the projects in the portfolio is a game we each all had to come up with on our own. For mine, I choose to do a game of snake with a fun little spin.

The other two major projects in the portfolio I believe are worth mentioning is a program called Poker Analysis and a little game of Pong.

Poker Analysis is a statistical representation of the probabilities of differrent 5 card hands. What this program does is that, in the background, the 
computer will generate hundreds of thousands of card hands, each 5 cards of the hand randomnly drawn from a 52 card deck, and count the results of all the
hands (checking the hands for like Flush, Straight, 3 of a Kind, etc.). Then after gathering the data, the results with display visually on the screen.
One of the biggest challences was dealing with efficiency and I was able to optimize by seeing what actions took the longest by utilizing the debugging
feature.
